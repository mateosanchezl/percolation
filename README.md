# Algorithms 1 - Percolation Simulation with Monte Carlo

This project implements an assignment from Princeton University's Algorithms 1 course in Python, adding an extra feature for performance comparison. It uses Monte Carlo simulations to test the time complexity of **Quick Find** and **Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression**.

---

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This simulation estimates percolation thresholds and compares the performance of two algorithms:
- **Quick Find**: A straightforward union-find implementation.
- **Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression**: An optimized union-find that minimizes tree height.

Both algorithms simulate connectivity in a grid `n` times, with runtimes displayed for direct comparison.

## ðŸš€ Usage
