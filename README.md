# Percolation

This is my implementation of an assignment in [Algorithms 1 by Princeton University](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) in Python.  
An extra feature was implemented where the program runs the Monte Carlo Simulation $n$ times using Quick Find as well as Weighted Quick Union with path compression and displays the time taken for both algorithms to simulate their time complexity.
